# Multiple choice comic book quiz game
a multiple choice quiz game web based application based on DC and Marvel comic books.
there are 8 questions selected at random, when an answer is clicked the color will change displaying green on the correct answer and red on the incorrect answers.
there is a bug in the scorekeeping I am in the process of attempting to fix.
below is an image of the deployed webpage
